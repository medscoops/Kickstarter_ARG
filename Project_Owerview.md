TASK
Analyse and model success factors of kickstarter campaigns. Give new projects an idea what is needed for a successful funding and  potentially even predict campaign success upfront.


HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS
    In recent years, the range of funding options for projects created by individuals and small companies has expanded considerably. In addition to savings, bank loans, friends & family funding and other traditional options, crowdfunding has become a popular and readily available alternative.
Kickstarter, founded in 2009, is one particularly well-known and popular crowdfunding platform. It has an all-or-nothing funding model, whereby a project is only funded if it meets its goal amount; otherwise no money is given by backers to a project.
 A huge variety of factors contribute to the success or failure of a project â€” in general, and also on Kickstarter. Some of these are able to be quantified or categorized, which allows for the construction of a model to attempt to predict whether a project will succeed or not. The aim of this project is to construct such a model and also to analyse Kickstarter project data more generally, in order to help potential project creators assess whether or not Kickstarter is a good funding option for them, and what their chances of success are.

MILESTONES
1. Project goal is defined (20.10 at 15:00)
2. Columns/features//variables are selected (by end of 20.10)
2. Data is cleaned (by noon 21.10)
3. Final model ready (by end of 21.10)
4. Presentation (by end 24.10)
5. Fine-tuning (by end 25.10)


TASKS
1. Load and check dataset
    * Codebook for the columns of the data set (Kickstarter terminology)
    * Data cleaning
2. Define a stakeholder and business case
    * Idea 1: Kickstarter hires us
    * Idea 2: Someone iterested in using Kickstarter hires us
    * Both ideas: Predict success
        * Success definition: Getting sufficient money for realizing the idea during the agreed timeline
    * Difference between the two ideas in terms of model performance:
        * Kickstarter is interested in a good predictive model (accuracy)
        (* Person is interested in a good prediction for her specific case (predictive value))
    * Difference in terms of business performance
        * Kickstarter earns mony wether the person is successful or not, but more successful persons might be better publicity
        (* Person might loose much time if she/he fails to realize her/his idea though Kickstarter)
3. Make a data-based success probability prediction for the business case
    * Kickstarter: accurate model with economic selection of predictors
    (* Person: accurate individual prediction for her business case)
